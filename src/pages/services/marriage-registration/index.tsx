          Court marriage, also known as civil marriage or registry marriage, is
          a legal process of getting married that takes place in a courthouse or
          a registry office. It is a simple and straightforward process that
          allows couples to establish a legal recognition of their relationship
          without any religious or traditional ceremonies. Here is a general
          outline of the process involved in a court marriage: Marriage
          Registration Application: The couple needs to fill out an application
          form for marriage registration at the local marriage registrar’s
          office. The application usually requires details such as the couple’s
          names, addresses, ages, occupations, and a declaration of their
          intention to marry.
